My TIC-TAC-TOE Project

Introduction

This is a single page application that allows the user to create an account, sign in,
sign out, change their password, and most importantly, play the game of Tic Tac Toe.

You can see and play the game here: https://rnolan19.github.io/TicTacToe-client/

As an aspiring junior developer currently learning to code at General Assembly- Boston,
this project was a fun way to implement all the JavaScript, HTML, JQuery, and API
concepts I've learned so far during my first 3 weeks at GA.

My goal was just to create a functional tic tac toe game.Emphasis on functional.  I was
 not overly concerned with how the game looked, from a style/CSS perspective.  I just
 wanted to create a game that would allow 2 people to successfully play the timeless
 game of Tic Tac Toe.  It was certainly harder than it appears, but I feel that the 'learn by
 doing' or 'trial by fire' approach really forces you to internalize all the concepts that we
 have learned in the classroom so far.  You are forced to come up with solutions that you
 otherwise would not in the classroom.

Technologies Used

I created the game primarily by using JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and an API.

User Stories

-As a user, I would like to be able to create an account and sign up easily.
-As a user, I would like to be able to sign in with ease.
-As a user, I would to be able to change my password once signed in.
-As a user, I would like to be able to start a new game once signed in.
-As a user, I would like feedback when I make a valid or invalid move.
-As a user, I would like to know the result of the game- win, lose, or draw.
-As a user, I would like to be able to continue playing if I want to.
-As a user, I would like to know how many games I have played.
-As a user, I would like to sign out when I am done playing.

Hiccups/Difficult Aspects of the Project

-Trying to come up with the function to switch player turns from X to 0 was the First
roadblock moment.
-Creating the Update Game/Patch API was probably the part I struggled with the most.
-Creating the game logic to find a winner and displaying the message to the user also
proved to be difficult, as my 'win message' and 'player turn messages' kept interfering
with eachother.

Problems To Be Solved In Future Iterations

-More time spent on design. It is admittedly not the prettiest looking Tic Tac Toe game
I have ever seen.  But that not was the focus of this verson.
-I would like to be able to show the user their lifetime win-loss record, if possible.
